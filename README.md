Hi, I`m Mikhail! 

I am interested in web development especially in the context of the frontend.
I'm currently learning Bootstrap framework and pure JavaScript.

I have a background in HTML/HTML5 (strong), CSS/CSS3 (strong), SASS/SCSS (strong), JS (basic, but I`m already improving). 
I work with design layouts in Figma, PSD, Zeplin, etc. I make responsive web-pages and w3c-valid HTML and CSS code, prefer SASS preprocessor, usually use Flexbox in my CSS.
Iâ€™m looking to any collaboration.
