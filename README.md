Hi, I`m Mikhail! 

I am interested in web development especially in the context of the frontend.
I'm currently learning PHP.

I have a background in HTML/HTML5, CSS/CSS3, SASS/SCSS, JS, Vue.js, Node.js, Webpack, PHP (basic). 
I work with design layouts in Figma, PSD, Zeplin, etc. I make responsive web-pages and w3c-valid HTML and CSS code, prefer SASS preprocessor, usually use Flexbox in my CSS.
Iâ€™m looking to any collaboration.
